# Nava-take-home Project (1hr 3mins).

Please note that I am aware of the finer details that I didn't complete for this assignment such as the font (styles, color, family), responsive, testing, documentation, and even taking another pass through the code to ensure my standard of quality. With that being said. I wanted to honor the 1 hour timeslot allocated for the project. I hope you enjoy!
